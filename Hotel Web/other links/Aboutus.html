                <h1> About Paradise Resorts </h1>
                <p>
                    Paradise Resorts, are an Indian hospitality chain of leased and franchised hotels, homes and living spaces. 
                    Founded in 2020 by Team SEPM, Paradise initially consisted mainly of budget hotels in Kolkata, Jaipur and Chennai. The startup expanded 
                    gradually with multiple resorts, vacation homes and homestays in different corners of India and expanding abroad.
                    
Nestled beside an 18-hole golf course minutes from the slopes, Hotel Park City is consistently acclaimed among the best hotels in Shimla. Among our most recent accolades, our AAA Four Diamond resort has proudly been rated a “Top Ski Hotel” by Conde
 Nast Traveler, and our Ruth’s Chris Steak House is the #1 rated Ruth’s Chris Steak House in the western coasts of Goa. We’ve also been placed in the Certificate of Excellence Hall of Fame by TripAdvisor and earned the Certificate of Excellence (TripAdvisor), a Platinum Choice Award (Smart Meetings Magazine), recognition as a “Most Admired Company” (by prestigeous Economic Times, TOI Magazine) and more.
